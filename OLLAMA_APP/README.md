# OLLAMA_APP

A standalone Python project scaffold (managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)) for building an app on top of a local Ollama server. Currently just the `uv init` starting point — `main.py` has no Ollama integration yet.

## Requirements

- Python 3.14 (pinned in `.python-version`)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com) installed and running locally, with at least one model pulled (see [`GEN-AI/README.md`](../GEN-AI/README.md) for pulling/storage notes)

## Running

```bash
uv run main.py
```
